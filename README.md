# Rocket-Elevators-Golang-Controller

This project is part of my second coding bootcamp project (October 2022) and implements an elevator control system design that passes all the provided tests. 

## Introduction
The Elevator Control System is designed to manage and control the movement of elevators within a building. It provides functions and algorithms to handle elevator requests, floor destinations, and elevator state management. 

## Other Language version:
[Javascript](https://github.com/0xJungleMonkey/Rocket-Elevators-Javascript-Controller/)
[Python](https://github.com/0xJungleMonkey/Rocket-Elevators-Python-Controller)
[C#](https://github.com/0xJungleMonkey/Rocket-Elevators-Controller-CSharp)


### Installation

With golang installed on your computer, all you need to do is initialize the module:

`go mod init Rocket-Elevators-Commercial-Controller`

The code to run the scenarios is included, and can be executed with:

`go run . <SCENARIO-NUMBER>`

### Running the tests

To launch the tests:

`go test`


With a fully completed project, you should get an output like:

!OutPut(https://github.com/0xJungleMonkey/-Rocket-Elevators-Golang-Controller/blob/1ce36428cf97d3dc315b46492ff43614f22ac892/output1.png)        "Test pass output")
